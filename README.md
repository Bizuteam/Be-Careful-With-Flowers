This project is an advanced project of the one given at my first year of university.

The goal of this project is to be presented where first years see it, with teachers bashing our work, to "bully" a bit the first years by making them fear the project before they get the real subject.

TODO:

- Create all classes with basic attributes and methods (Stats, Monster, Items, Char);
- Finish Map related class + make one basic map to test.
- Implement terminal mode and gui mode (with SDL);
